        <p class="p_about_desc_big">A 3,000-mile endurance challenge from
            California to Maryland, was a dream realized. For years, I had looked forward to this event, knowing it
            would be the ultimate test of my physical and mental strength. With 20 years of cycling experience, I felt
            ready for the grueling ride ahead. The race was relentless—riding through desert heat, battling fatigue, and
            conquering brutal mountain climbs. Each mile pushed my limits, with my support crew keeping me fueled and
            motivated. When I crossed the finish line in Annapolis, I finished third, a feat I hadn’t imagined. RAAM
            tested my strength and willpower, but it also showed me just how far I could push myself.</p>
